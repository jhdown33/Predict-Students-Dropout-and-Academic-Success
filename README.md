Kaggle Dataset - Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success

Dataset Overview:

This dataset provides valuable insights into predicting student dropout and academic success in higher education institutions. Collected from various disjoint databases, it includes data on students enrolled in a range of undergraduate programs, such as Agronomy, Design, Education, Nursing, Journalism, Management, Social Service, and Technologies.

The dataset contains a variety of features collected at the time of student enrollment, including academic path, demographics, and socio-economic factors. Additionally, it includes students' academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters. The goal is to build classification models that predict whether students are likely to drop out or succeed academically.

Key Features:

Academic path and degree program (Agronomy, Design, Nursing, etc.)
Demographics (age, gender, etc.)
Socio-economic factors (income level, family background, etc.)
Academic performance at the end of first and second semesters
Classification Task:

The dataset is structured for a three-category classification problem, where the target variable indicates the student's outcome (dropout, success, or other). Note that the data exhibits a strong class imbalance, which is a key challenge when developing predictive models.

A dataset created from a higher education institution (acquired from several disjoint databases) related to students enrolled in different undergraduate degrees, such as agronomy, design, education, nursing, journalism, management, social service, and technologies. The dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment (academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors) and the students' academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters. The data is used to build classification models to predict students' dropout and academic sucess. The problem is formulated as a three category classification task, in which there is a strong imbalance towards one of the classes.
